## Photo Guidelines

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or GIF

If a photo is not available, a default avatar icon will be displayed instead.

## How to Add Photos

1. Save your team member photo with the appropriate filename (e.g., `member1.jpg`)
2. Copy the file to this directory: `/web/static/images/team/`
3. Refresh the About page to see the updated photo

You can also update the team member names and roles by editing the `/web/templates/about.html` file.
